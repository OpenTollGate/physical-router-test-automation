# scripts/offline/install-router.sh
#
# The ROUTER-side half of the WAN-less (offline) install path.  It is a bundle
# member: install-offline.sh (the laptop-side driver) stages it to the router
# through an `ssh 'cat > …'` stdin redirect — never scp, because `scp -O` fails
# on a fresh dropbear (no sftp-server) — and runs it with the router's own shell.
#
# ORDER IS THE DELIVERABLE.  Steps, in this order and no other:
#
#   1. seed + APPLY /etc/uci-defaults/99z-mgmt-keepalive (workstation MAC →
#      nodogsplash trustedmac, plus `allow tcp port 22`) and assert the trust is
#      LIVE — before anything can start enforcement.  This ordering is not
#      optional and the script fails closed without it: nodogsplash turns
#      `users_to_router` into its pre-auth ruleset once, at start-up, so a
#      package install/upgrade with no pre-auth SSH path locks the wired
#      management workstation out.  That wedge bricked the bench twice
#      (2026-08-16/17).
#   2. `apk add --no-network --allow-untrusted --force-missing-repositories` on the
#      dependency files BY PATH.  --force-missing-repositories is required, not
#      cosmetic: without it apk aborts on every missing feed index even with
#      --no-network (a WAN-less router has no indexes at all).
#   3. `apk add` the tollgate-wrt package (its postinst applies the policy).
#   4. assert, fail closed, and print a machine-readable report.
#
# Every check is a gate with a state (pass/fail/info) recorded in the report, and
# every refusal names what is wrong and what to do about it.
#
# The br-lan-client refusal of :8090/:8443 is NOT asserted here — a router cannot
# test its own br-lan drops (locally generated traffic to a local address never
# traverses the input hook with iifname br-lan).  It is asserted by the driver,
# from the workstation that is actually on br-lan, and merged into the final
# report.
#
# ACCEPTANCE IS CONDITIONAL ON THE UPLINK.  A fresh-flash box has no WAN, so a
# BOLT11 quote is impossible by construction; the quote gate therefore asserts
# GRACEFUL DEGRADATION there (the /ln-invoice route must answer, in a documented
# degraded shape, without wedging) and says so explicitly in the report
# (`gate_bolt11_quote=info`, `fact_bolt11_assertable=no`) instead of failing a
# correct install.  With an uplink the original strict contract applies, unchanged.
# Surface probes use the path each service ACTUALLY serves (see SURFACE_CONTRACT):
# the bare `/` is not the portal's page.
#
# Exit codes (identical in install-offline.sh):
#   0  pass
#   2  usage
#   4  a declared dependency is missing from the bundle
#   5  keepalive/lockout risk — refusing to install
#   6  staged file does not match its manifest entry (name/substitution)
#   7  an apk install failed
#   8  a dependency has no runtime payload (empty stub) — nodogsplash would crash-loop
#   9  a post-install assertion failed

# --- WAN availability: the ONE input that decides which payment contract applies -----
# A BOLT11 quote is minted by a REMOTE mint that is addressed by NAME, so it needs an
# uplink.  A fresh-flash WAN-less GL-MT3000 has none, and the 2026-09-28 hardware run is
# the evidence: `logread` showed the mint (kashu.me) failing DNS and `merchant is still
# initializing`, and the endpoint never produced a quote.  Demanding one unconditionally
# made a CORRECT WAN-less install fail its own acceptance gates (exit 9).
#
# The probe is router-local, does no package/HTTP I/O, and mirrors the failure the
# hardware actually showed (`kashu.me` had no address): a quote needs the mint's NAME to
# resolve, so it needs BOTH
#   * a default route — the kernel's own answer to "is there an uplink"
#     (/proc/net/route; busybox `ip route` is not guaranteed on a minimal image), and
#   * a nameserver to resolve with — read as FILES, deliberately: BusyBox ash resolves
#     `nslookup`/`ping` as INTERNAL applets and ignores PATH, so a command-based DNS probe
#     is neither harness-drivable nor safe to read as evidence.
# A route with no resolver is NOT an uplink for quoting purposes.
#
# AMBIGUITY IS NOT AN ESCAPE HATCH.  The WAN-LESS branch is taken only on POSITIVE
# evidence — the route table was read and holds no default route, or it holds one and the
# box has no resolver.  If the route table cannot be read at all the box is judged
# WAN-PRESENT, so the STRICT quote contract applies: you cannot make the payment
# assertion disappear by blinding the probe (T28 pins exactly that).
# Sets WAN_ROUTE (yes|no|unknown) / WAN_RESOLVER (yes|no|n/a) and WAN_DIAG;

#                                in-repo sources document it), but only when the splash
#                                path itself is not 200 — so a box serving NEITHER still
