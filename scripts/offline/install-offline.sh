# scripts/offline/install-offline.sh
#
# The LAPTOP-side driver for the WAN-less (offline) install path, and the entry
# point of the `*-offline.tar.gz` release bundle.  One command, no internet on the
# router:
#
#     curl -fsSL <BUNDLE_URL> | tar -xz
#     cd tollgate-wrt-<version>-<arch>-offline
#     ./install-offline.sh 192.168.1.1 '<router-password>'
#
# The bundle is fetched where there IS internet (the operator's laptop); the router
# never needs an uplink.  Everything the router needs travels in the bundle:
# pkgs/ (the tollgate-wrt package plus the full dependency closure), MANIFEST.sha256,
# install-router.sh (the ordered router-side sequence), templates/99z-mgmt-keepalive
# and README.md.
#
# WHAT THIS DRIVER DOES
#   0. laptop-side preflight: the bundle's own sha256 manifest must verify, whole
#      and untouched, BEFORE a single byte is pushed to the router.
#   1. stage + APPLY the management keepalive seed — first, always (see
#      install-router.sh; skipping it bricked the bench on 2026-08-16/17).
#   2. stage the package closure through `ssh 'cat > …'` stdin redirects.  Never
#      scp: `scp -O` fails on a fresh dropbear because there is no sftp-server.
#   3. run the ordered router-side sequence and pass its exit code through.
#   4. probe the br-lan client view with the same surface contract the router side
#      uses (`/splash.html` on the portal, :2051 200|403, :8080 307|no plain-HTTP
#      answer — a plain 307 may not be required with redirect_https — and
#      :8090/:8443 refused) — a router cannot test its own br-lan drops, so this
#      half of the verification belongs to the workstation that is actually on
#      br-lan — then merge both halves into one machine-readable report.
#      The BOLT11/quote assertion is uplink-conditional and lives on the router side.
#
# Exit codes (identical to install-router.sh, plus the two laptop-side ones):
#   0 pass · 2 usage · 3 the bundle failed its own manifest check · 4 missing
#   dependency · 5 keepalive/lockout risk · 6 staged name/hash binding · 7 apk failed
#   · 8 runtime payload missing · 9 a post-install assertion failed ·
#   10 cannot reach the router · 11 router image unsupported for this lane
