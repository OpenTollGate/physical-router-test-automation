# =============================================================================
# Guard: no workflow reachable from an untrusted PR event may touch the bench.
# =============================================================================
# WHY: a `pull_request` trigger plus a `[self-hosted, tollgate-router]` runner
# means any contributor's PR code executes on the machine that flashes routers,
# holds the repo secrets and sits in the bench's L1/L2 neighbourhood. The
# previous state (ci.yml `test-ui` / `test-physical` at `if: false` on a
# pull_request-triggered workflow) was one flipped boolean away from that, and
# the job force-enabled router-mutating, paid-traffic specs besides.
#
# RULES
#   R1  A workflow with a pull_request / pull_request_target trigger must not
#       reach a bench runner. "Reach a bench runner" is decided on the LABEL
#       SET, not on the literal `self-hosted` string: every label used by the
#       hardware workflow's `runs-on` (plus `self-hosted`, plus anything in
#       HW_RUNNER_LABELS_EXTRA) is denied, and an expression-valued `runs-on:`
#       is rejected outright because it cannot be verified by reading. It must
#       also not reference any bench-mutating env flag. An `on:` written as a
#       flow mapping (`on: {…}`) is ALSO a violation: the trigger parser cannot
#       read it, so PR-reachability becomes undecidable and the file cannot be
#       proven bench-safe.
#   R2  The hardware workflow (default `hw-smoke.yml`) must exist, must NOT be
#       PR-reachable, and its triggers must be a subset of
#       {workflow_dispatch, schedule} — maintainer-triggered only.
#   R3  No disabled job parked behind a falsy `if:` anywhere in
#       .github/workflows/ (case-insensitive `false` — bare, quoted, inside an
#       expression, or as the body of a folded `if: >-` scalar — plus the
#       YAML-1.1 falsy words `no`/`off`, numeric `0` and a quoted empty string).
#       A job parked behind a flag is an invitation to flip it; enablement must
#       be an explicit input / repo variable / environment approval.
#   R4  Any job that references a bench-mutating env flag must declare
#       `environment:` NAMED `$HW_ENVIRONMENT_NAME` (default `bench-hardware`) —
#       presence of the key is not enough, a typo'd environment would silently
#       drop the required-reviewer gate.
#   R5  In the hardware workflow, any job that uses `secrets.` must declare the
#       same named environment too — the read-only lane must stay
#       credential-free.
#   R6  No bench-label runner outside the hardware workflow. R1 only arms on
#       files whose triggers the parser can read, and R2/R4/R5 only ever look at
#       the hardware workflow — so a self-hosted job added to a THIRD file
#       (push-triggered, or `workflow_call`-able and therefore reachable from a
#       pull_request-triggered caller) would otherwise pass every rule. Bench
#       work lives in exactly one file. A file that legitimately runs on a
#       DIFFERENT self-hosted fleet must be named in
#       HW_NON_BENCH_SELF_HOSTED_ALLOW and is reported as an explicit
#       exception on every run, never silently skipped; unverifiable `runs-on`
#       targets in it still fail closed.
#
# LIMIT (stated, not hidden): this guard runs from the PR's own checkout, so a
# hostile PR can delete it in the same commit that adds the self-hosted job.
# For that class of PR the mechanical protection is branch protection + the
# `lint` check being REQUIRED, not this script. See docs/hw-lane-isolation.md.
#
# Only effective YAML is scanned: full-line and trailing comments are stripped
# first, so documentation prose (which necessarily names the anti-patterns it
# bans) cannot trip the guard.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/ci/check-workflow-hw-isolation.sh [WORKFLOWS_DIR]
#   Exit 0 = safe. Exit 1 = unsafe (every violation printed as file: R# …).
#   Env knobs: HW_WORKFLOW_NAME, HW_ENVIRONMENT_NAME, HW_RUNNER_LABELS_EXTRA
#              (space-separated extra runner labels to deny).
#
# The guard's own RED/GREEN matrix lives in
# scripts/ci/test-check-workflow-hw-isolation.sh — a guard never seen red is
# decoration, not evidence. It runs in the ci.yml `lint` job on every PR.
