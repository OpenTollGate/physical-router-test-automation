# tests/offline-install/run-tests.sh — the NO-HARDWARE suite for the WAN-less
# (offline) install path.
#
# What it proves, without a router and without a network:
#
#   * the ordered, no-brick sequence really is ordered — the management keepalive is
#     seeded AND applied before anything can start enforcement, and the install refuses
#     to continue when it is missing or when the trust did not take (the 2026-08-16/17
#     bench wedge);
#   * the dependency install passes --no-network --allow-untrusted
#     --force-missing-repositories BY PATH, and that the last flag is load-bearing
#     (the apk double aborts without it, exactly as a real WAN-less router's apk does);
#   * the dependency install offers apk the WHOLE staged closure — and the AS-SHIPPED
#     stage (only REQUIRED_DEPS + STUB_OK_DEPS) REFUSES on a fresh box, which is the
#     wave-3 defect this suite exists to keep fixed (T20: apk refuses the whole
#     transaction, `REFUSED(7)`, and the negation's rc=0 was misreported).  The control
#     runs the same as-shipped stage on an UPGRADE box, where it passes — the defect was
#     fresh-box only, which is why it survived three waves of bench installs;
#   * the negative controls from the card, one test each:
#       (a) a bundle missing a dependency            -> refuses, naming it
#       (b) the keepalive step removed               -> refuses with the lockout reason
#       (c) a runtime dep satisfied by an empty stub -> refuses (NDS would crash-loop)
#       (d) a manifest mismatch                      -> refuses before installing anything
#       (e) an apk named differently than the manifest -> refuses
#     plus: no admin-board guard in the payload, no firewall reload in the postinst,
#     a wrong surface code, no BOLT11 quote, SSH not listening;
#   * the WAN-LESS acceptance contract (the 2026-09-28 hardware defect): on a box with no
#     uplink a BOLT11 quote is impossible by construction, so the quote gate must report
#     itself as NOT ASSERTABLE (gate_bolt11_quote=info, fact_bolt11_assertable=no) and
#     assert graceful degradation instead — while a missing /ln-invoice route, a missing
#     portal splash page or a dead port still FAILS the run (T23/T24/T25);
#   * the SAME run with a FAKED UPLINK (T22), where the surfaces and the BOLT11 quote are
#     asserted exactly as before the fix, and nothing is reported as not-assertable;
#   * the green path end to end: dependencies, package, payload identity, version,
#     surfaces probed at the paths they actually serve (/splash.html on the portal, :2051
#     200|403, :8080 307|no plain-HTTP answer), the guard loaded with NO manual reload,
#     SSH alive, the uplink-appropriate /ln-invoice outcome, the br-lan client view, and
#     one machine-readable report with zero failing gates.
#
# The router is a throw-away directory; ssh/scp/apk/uci/nft/curl are PATH doubles in
# harness/bin/.  The production script text is what runs — including under the shell
# OpenWrt actually ships (BusyBox ash), which is why nothing here is a skip.

# file list from REQUIRED_DEPS + STUB_OK_DEPS, so a FRESHLY FLASHED box was handed 4 of
# the bundle's staged packages.  apk-tools 3 resolves a transaction from the files NAMED
# on the command line plus the installed DB and from nothing else, so nodogsplash's
# iptables closure (`iptables-nft`, `iptables-mod-conntrack-extra`,
# `iptables-mod-ipopt`, `iptables-mod-nat-extra`) read `(no such package)` and apk
# refused the WHOLE transaction → `REFUSED(7)`, on a box the bundle carried every
# package for.  On an UPGRADE box those deps are already installed, so the transaction
# resolved from the DB and the stage looked correct — which is why three waves of bench
# installs never saw it.
#
# T20 runs the AS-SHIPPED stage (the pre-fix text, rebuilt by reversing the fix in the
# shipped file) as a CONTROL, so the green assertions cannot be vacuous:
#   (a) fresh box, as-shipped   -> REFUSED(7), only the top-level deps offered, and the
#                                  gate reports the NEGATION's rc (0), not apk's
#   (b) upgrade box, as-shipped -> PASS: the defect is fresh-box only

#   (d) apk's REAL rc reaches the gate, on both the shipped and the as-shipped stage

# =============================================================== runner
# =============================================================== T29 keepalive seed, unit level
# The SAME defect T21 covers end to end through install-router.sh, driven here at the SEED -
# the level at which it is fixed - so this group can also pin the two things an end-to-end run
# cannot: that a RE-RUN of the seed is idempotent, and that the file-ensure line stays in the
# shape the FEED BUILDER recognises (if it drifts, a pinned seed gets the builder's own step
# re-applied on top of it - the double-write class of bug feed PR #38 removed).
#
# The defect this group exists for: on a freshly flashed WAN-less box /etc/config has
# NO nodogsplash — nodogsplash is one of the 38 packages the bundle DELIVERS, so it is
# not installed yet when the keepalive seed runs.  Real `uci` cannot create a section in
# a config file that does not exist: `uci add nodogsplash nodogsplash` prints
# "uci: Entry not found" and exits 3 (measured on a bench MT3000, fresh flash, WAN-less,
# 2026-09-28; with the file created first the very same call exits 0).  It cannot resolve
# the anonymous section @nodogsplash[0] without the file either, so the seed's add_list
# calls land NOTHING — and the seed ignores errors and exits 0 anyway.  install-router.sh's
# keepalive_applied gate then finds no trustedmac / no 'allow tcp port 22' and REFUSES
# with exit 5 on a first flash: a bundle refused by the gate for a package the bundle
# itself delivers.
#
# The fix is in the seed, so this group drives the SEED directly (the router's own
# shell, the uci double on PATH, TGOFFLINE_ROOT standing in for the filesystem):
#   (a) fresh box, shipped seed    -> the config file is created, the section exists,
#                                     the trust lands, and a RE-RUN is idempotent
#   (b) fresh box, file-ensure line removed (scratch copy of the seed INSIDE the
#       harness, never the repo file) -> the SAME assertions FAIL, and they fail for
#       the right reason: no config file is created and the trust never lands.  The
#       control also pins the mechanism itself (guard_rc=3 / uci: Entry not found
#       without the file, rc=0 with it), so the green assertions cannot be vacuous.

# wait must turn a one-shot 000 into a pass, while a port whose correct answer IS 000
# (the admin-board pair) still never waits — that is what the deadline=0 controls above

TITLES="
T01|dry-run: verify the bundle, print the ordered plan, touch nothing
T02|green path: keepalive first, deps by path, package, all gates, one report
T03|(a) a bundle missing a dependency refuses, naming it
T04|(b) a bundle without the keepalive seed refuses with the lockout reason
T05|(b2) a keepalive whose trust did not take refuses before installing
T06|(c) a runtime dep satisfied by an empty stub refuses (NDS would crash-loop)
T07|(c2) a router with no iptables payload refuses
T08|(d) a manifest mismatch refuses before installing anything
T09|(e) an apk the manifest does not name is refused
T10|(e2) the router-side name/hash binding gate refuses a foreign or renamed package
T11|an artifact without the admin-board guard fragment fails the gate
T12|a postinst that never reloads fw4 fails the guard gate (no manual reload, ever)
T13|a wrong surface code fails the surface gates
T14|no BOLT11 quote fails the quote gate
T15|a router with no SSH listener fails the ssh gate
T16|--force-missing-repositories is load-bearing (behaviour changes without it)
T17|the production scripts run under the router's shell (BusyBox ash / dash)
T18|staging never uses scp (stdin redirect only)
T19|the machine-readable report has every gate, in JSON, with the remote half embedded
T20|the dependency closure on a FRESH box (as-shipped refusal + upgrade-box control)
T21|the keepalive seed on a FRESH box (pre-fix refusal control + shipped seed makes trust live)
T22|FAKED WAN: surfaces AND the BOLT11 quote asserted, quote reported assertable
T23|non-vacuity: WAN-less with the /ln-invoice route gone still fails, naming it
T24|non-vacuity: a missing portal splash page still fails, naming the surface
T25|non-vacuity: a surface with no listener still fails, naming the port
T26|the WAN probe needs a resolver, not just a route (the bench box's actual state)
T27|the OTHER documented portal shape (bare root) is accepted, not failed
T28|anti-vacuity: an unreadable WAN probe does NOT buy the lenient branch
T29|the keepalive seed at the unit level (config file + section ensured; idempotent; feed-builder shape)
T30|a surface that answers 000 once is recovered by the bounded wait (the hardware startup shape)
