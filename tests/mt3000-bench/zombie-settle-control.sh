# zombie-settle-control.sh — prove the PHASE 5b convergence assertions CAN fail.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   On 2026-09-26 (module pin 2796d96c) a client that left nodogsplash left the module with an
#   UNRETIRABLE session: `ndsctl deauth` answered `Client <mac> not found.` and exited 1, the
#   module read that exit status as an unconfirmed close, retried it at the sweep cadence for ever
#   (`unconfirmed_closes` 113 -> 193 -> 195), never retired the session, logged the false warning
#   "this client may still hold open, unmetered access", and drove ndsctl until its socket died —
#   after which a PAID purchase could not be authorised at all (state=PAID, wallet +1 sat,
#   access_granted never true). `second-purchase-e2e.sh` now asserts, in PHASE 5b, that the module
#   CONVERGES on an address nodogsplash no longer knows — the phase runs where a client LEAVES with
#   its PAID allotment still open, which is the state that reproduced the leak.
#
#   An assertion that has never been seen red is decoration. This control extracts the helpers and
#   the PHASE 5b block FROM THE SCRIPT (so it cannot drift out of sync with it), drives them with a
#   stubbed transport and a stubbed `sleep`, and asserts both directions:
#     * a module that settles the address, stops escalating and keeps ndsctl answerable => rc 0;
#     * a module that never settles it (the measured leak)                       => rc 13;
#     * a settle line that PREDATES the phase's marker (buy#1's exhaustion)       => rc 13, because
#       the phase anchors its window; a whole-buffer read would have called that convergence. The
#       anti-vacuity check at the end runs exactly that comparison and fails the control if an
#       un-anchored read ever becomes able to reject the stale line;
#     * a module whose unconfirmed-closes total keeps climbing                    => rc 13;
#     * a module that escalates the client again after it left                    => rc 13;
#     * a module that claims unmetered access for a MAC nodogsplash does not know => rc 13;
#     * an ndsctl socket that stops answering during the settle window            => rc 13;
#     * a wedged-socket line in the window                                        => rc 13.
#
#   The extraction itself is checked both ways: it must BE the settle phase, and it must not have
#   swallowed PHASE 5 (whose `buy "$TOKEN_2" "buy#2"` reached the extracted block through the
#   blanket end marker this control used to carry, killing it on an unbound TOKEN_2 before it
#   asserted anything).
