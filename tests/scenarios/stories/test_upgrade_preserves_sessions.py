"""User Story: A router with active sessions upgrades without losing them.

Tests the upgrade path: a running TollGate with a paid session gets a
new ipk installed (service restart, not full reflash). The session
should persist — the client should still have internet after the upgrade.

This is the test that catches the "volatile wallet/session" class of bug
where a restart or upgrade wipes state that should be persistent.
