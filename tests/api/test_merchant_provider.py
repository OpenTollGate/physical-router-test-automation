"""Tests for MerchantProvider propagation to CLI and HTTP handlers.

Verifies that after degraded-to-full recovery, all consumers (HTTP handlers,
CLI wallet commands) see the new merchant via MerchantProvider instead of
holding a stale reference.

Key behaviors under test:
- CLI wallet balance/info reflect the swapped merchant after recovery
- All HTTP endpoints return structured degraded responses (not 500/panic)
- All HTTP endpoints work normally after recovery
- Concurrent requests during merchant swap don't cause 500s or panics
